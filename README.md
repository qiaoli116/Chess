# Chess game development logs
## 20210503
A console based chess game has been created. The game is now able to place/move pieces.

Next, I am going to explore hwo to implement a single server multi clients solution using named pipe as the server-client communication technology. Then I will run the chess game on the server and have multiple users be able to control the game from client apps.
